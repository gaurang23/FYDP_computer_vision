These files are a part of my Final Year Design Project at the University of Waterloo. My team and I worked on creating an underwater rover (ROV) that would be able to pick up submerged golf balls from the water-bed. These files deal with the image processing that was done on the incoming video feed to help the user in the detection of golf balls.
